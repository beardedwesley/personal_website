		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Recently relocated to Boise, ID, I've focused on school full time to get a degree that aligns with a lifetime's knowledge and experience focused on computers.  From hardware to software I'm familiar with the modern computing environment.  With extensive job experience in customer service, I've also got the people skills and communication skills that enable me to be an effective team member.</p>
