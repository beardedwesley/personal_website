			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Graduating with my B.S. Software Development degree in July 2020 was an official designation of a life always captivated by computers. As a child, a Windows 95 machine opened my inquisitive mind to the world of technology. In middle school, a macOS machine taught me to type (as opposed to pecking) and begin exploring the internet in the age of the dotcom. In high school, a programming class taught me some basic (VisualBasic, that is) coding skills and even how to comment. College has seen me delve into the world of coding full bore. Now with my sights are on growing my career in software development having a few years under my belt. With extensive job experience in customer service, I've also got the people skills and communication skills that enable me to be an effective team member.

				tl;dr: Always liked computers, ready to code applications and websites as part of a team.</p>
